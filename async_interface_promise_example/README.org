:END:
This project demonstrates how TypeScript interfaces, async functions, and promises work together.

** Concepts Demonstrated
- Defining interfaces with async methods that return promises
- Implementing interfaces with async/await syntax
- Type-safe promise handling with generics
- Error handling with async/await and promise chains
- Promise-based API design patterns

** Running the Example
To install dependencies:

#+begin_src sh
bun install
#+end_src

To run:

#+begin_src sh
bun run src/main.ts
#+end_src

** Project Structure
- ~src/main.ts~ - Contains the main example code demonstrating interfaces with async/await and promises

** Key Takeaways
- Interfaces can define methods that return Promises
- Async methods automatically return Promises
- TypeScript's generic system works well with Promises for type safety
- Both async/await and promise chaining can be used with interface implementations

This project was created using =bun init= in bun v1.1.40.
[[https://bun.sh][Bun]] is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
